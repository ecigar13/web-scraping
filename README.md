# web-scraping-truyenyy.com
Using python3-bs4 to scrape truyenyy.com so I can read it offline. 

***

This program uses BeautifulSoup4 to get all the chapters of a certain series on truyenyy.com. The URL is built-in to the program. You only need to supply the following to main():

 1. Name of the story to construct the URL e.g. "quan-than" as in https://truyenyy.com/truyen/quan-than/chuong-1830.html
 2. Name of the file to save to (preferably HTML)

I might add more scrapers to other sites if I permits.

The URL and html tag might change so you will need to modify the parameter of find() function to get the correct data.
